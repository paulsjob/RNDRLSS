# Renderless | Vision & Roadmap

## 1. High-Level Vision
Renderless is a cloud-native live graphics platform focused first on sports, with a roadmap into News, Finance, and Enterprise broadcasts. By decoupling data ingestion from visual rendering, Renderless allows broadcasters to deliver high-fidelity, data-driven graphics across traditional broadcast (16:9), social mobile (9:16), and digital displays (1:1) from a single source of truth.

## 2. Platform Roadmap

### Phase 1: Sports Foundation (Current)
- Canonical Dictionaries for MLB, NFL, and Soccer.
- Real-time LiveBus protocol with sub-100ms latency.
- Multi-aspect ratio design canvas with responsive overrides.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & News
- **Lower Third Automation**: Automatic graphic triggering based on speech-to-text or data events.
- **News Tickers**: Multi-source aggregation (RSS, X/Twitter, Internal AP feeds) for perpetual crawls.
- **Election Graphics**: Rapid-deployment templates for real-time vote counting and heatmaps.

### Phase 3: Financial Markets
- **Market Pulse**: Real-time candlestick and line chart rendering for stocks and crypto.
- **Order Book Visualizers**: High-frequency data overlays for professional trading streams.

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Events
- **Hybrid Overlays**: AR-ready graphics for remote presenters and virtual stages.
- **Q&A Integration**: Moderated live question displays with real-time upvoting logic.

## 3. Core Values
- **Render-Once, Display-Everywhere**: Pixel-perfect response regardless of output medium.
- **Agnostic Ingestion**: Support any data provider via the Canonical Mapping Engine.
- **Cloud Scale**: Support thousands of concurrent live instances on global edge infrastructure.
